    <h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
    <p>
        Perhaps there's a theme here, two recipes that resemble the humble hot dog? Fear not, this is another winner!</br>
        Is it a hot dog or is it a hamburger? We still don't know what to classify it as, we've also been threatened with prison time if we ever serve this in public.
    </p>
    <p>
        This recipe is a fan favourite of ours, simple yet elegant and packed with flavour! What more could you want?</br>
        I suppose there's nothing more to do than tell you how to replicate this in your own home, so instructions are as follows.
    </p>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hot dog roll (not stale or mouldy is preferred)</li>
        <li>Burger pattie (beef preferrably, however we've had great success with room temperature 5 day old tuna)</li>
        <li>Cheese sticks (the cheaper the better)</li>
        <li><em>OPTIONAL:</em> Sauce for flavour (we don't believe you'll need it though)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>METHOD:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cry</li>
        <li>Tear hot dog bun open to make room for pattie</li>
        <li>Insert cheese sticks into roll</li>
        <li>Carefully add pattie in halves to roll, do this quietly to not attract evil spirits</li>
        <li>Serve on your filthiest plate with excess cheese sticks on the side</li>
        <li><em>OPTIONAL:</em> Add sauce</li>
        <li><em>OPTIONAL:</em> Call the police and confess your crimes</li>
    </ol>
